## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Works with openai's GPT-4. 

### Installation

1. Paste the prompt into openai's GPT-4 chatbot
2. Press 'Go'

## Usage

I tried it with Bing, who say that they have gpt4 but it doesn't work the same, so my guess is that openai's version of gpt4 is actually better at following instructions than bing version of gpt4 :). I have tried it on gpt3.5 turbo and it works most of the time but not always.
